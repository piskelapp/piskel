You can try the standalone editor at **http://juliandescottes.github.io/piskel** or see it integrated in **http://piskelapp.com**.

Piskel is mainly developped by :

* **[@juliandescottes](https://github.com/juliandescottes)**
* **[@grosbouddha](https://github.com/grosbouddha)**

## What's the point ?

You can use Piskel to do two things :
* **spriting** : create retro-style sprites for games

![Megaman spritesheet](http://piskel-imgstore-a.appspot.com/img/c8081287-ac58-11e3-bd8c-b3c4036c0eee.png "Megaman spritesheet")

* **pixelart** : create crazy/pretty pixelart animations for fun !

![Rabbit jumping](http://piskel-imgstore-a.appspot.com/img/947f2dab-ac58-11e3-949a-b3c4036c0eee.gif "Rabit jumping")

Integrated in **[piskelapp.com](http://piskelapp.com)**, you can share everything you work on with others as easily as you share a link.

## Requirements

Piskel supports the following browsers :
* **Chrome** (latest)
* **Firefox** (latest)
* **Internet Explorer** 11+

... and a fairly recent computer.

We don't plan/want/could be forced into supporting older IEs. For Opera and Safari, we've never tested them but the gap shouldn't be huge.

## Offline version

Offline builds are available. More details in the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/juliandescottes/piskel/wiki/Desktop-applications).

## Built with

The Piskel editor is purely built in **JavaScript, HTML and CSS**. It uses Canvas extensively for displaying all them pretty sprites.

We also use the following **libraries** :
* [spectrum](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum) : awesome standalone colorpicker
* [gifjs](http://jnordberg.github.io/gif.js/) : generate animated GIFs in javascript, using webworkers
* [supergif](https://github.com/buzzfeed/libgif-js) : modified version of SuperGif to parse and import GIFs
* [jszip](https://github.com/Stuk/jszip) : create, read and edit .zip files with Javascript
* [canvas-toBlob](https://github.com/eligrey/canvas-toBlob.js/) : shim for canvas toBlob
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/) : used sporadically in the application
* [bootstrap-tooltip](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) : nice tooltips

As well as some **icons** from the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/) :
* Folder by Simple Icons from The Noun Project
* (and probably one or two others)
